# Understanding-of-Callbacks

Callbacks are functions used in deep learning frameworks to monitor and modify the behavior of a neural network during training. They are called at specific points in the training process and can be used to perform tasks such as logging metrics, saving model checkpoints, adjusting the learning rate, and stopping training early if a certain condition is met.

Some common callbacks used in deep learning include:

- ModelCheckpoint:
This callback saves the model weights after each epoch or at specified intervals during training, allowing the training process to be resumed from a specific checkpoint if necessary.

- EarlyStopping:
This callback monitors a specific metric, such as the validation loss, and stops training early if the metric does not improve for a specified number of epochs. This can prevent overfitting and save time by stopping training when further improvement is unlikely.

- LearningRateScheduler:
This callback adjusts the learning rate during training based on a predefined schedule or function. This can be useful for achieving better performance by gradually decreasing the learning rate as the training progresses.

- ReduceLROnPlateau:
This callback reduces the learning rate if a specific metric, such as the validation loss, has not improved for a certain number of epochs. This can help the model converge more quickly and achieve better performance.

- CSVLogger:
This callback logs the training and validation metrics to a CSV file, allowing the results to be easily analyzed and visualized.

Callbacks provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for customizing the training process and improving the performance of a neural network. They can be used to automate common tasks, optimize hyperparameters, and prevent common problems such as overfitting and slow convergence.
